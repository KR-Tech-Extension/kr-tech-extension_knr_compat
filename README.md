# KR Tech Extension-Kaiserreich Naval Rework Compatibility Patch

### Last Updated for June 4, 2024. (KR's 1.1.3 release; KNR 2024-Jun-1 release)
### This compatibility patch will only be assumed to work with mod version specified in the description unless said otherwise due to the extensive modification of tech trees by both submods.

This is the official compatibility patch for [KR Tech Extension](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3105210203) and [Kaiserreich Naval Rework](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2862849828). As of the current release, this only transposes Kaiserreich Naval Rework's naval tech tree in place of KRTX's own implementation.

### All MrPunk's Naval Rework mod that works with this compatch:

1) Download this submod.
2) Delete any former versions and ensure that you've unsubscribed from the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3169405730) version of this mod.
3) Extract the .zip to `Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod\kr-tech-extension_knr_compat`.
4) Make a copy of the `descriptor.mod` file in the folder, rename it to `kr-tech-extension_knr_compat.mod` and put it in `Hearts of Iron IV\mod`.

### Due to tech tree conflict, this patch doesn't work with the following compatch for KRTX:
- [KR Tech Extension-RT56 Steel Aluminium Standalone Compatibility Patch](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3167575134)

### Official Compatibility Patches:
