### Short Maintenance Guide (gotta reduce the "bus factor" and keep things simple)

##
## Part 1: Absolutely Required List
##

## \common\decisions:
- Use "military_training_decisions.txt" from KRTX, replace `modern_depth_charges_3` with `rocket_depth_charges`.

## \common\technologies:
- Copy over "naval_doctrine.txt" from KNR, add all the appropriate `SH_battleship` entries where `battleship` exists, move `battle_cruiser` to where `heavy_cruiser` entries to the "modern_theory" section copied over from KRTX.

## \interface:
- Use "countrytechtreeview.gui" from KRTX, with `naval` down to `MTG_naval` section all copied over from KNR.

## \events
- Copy over all event files from KNR, update reference to latest KR standard as appropriate. (i.e. new AST ships now head straight to reserved fleet instead of loaded via OOB)

##
## Part 2: Error Suppression List (not critical, but it helps)
##

## \common\ai_equipment
- Copy over "KR_carriers.txt" from KR directly, remove all illegal entries of `ship_carrier_armor` (KNR remove that module).

## \common\
- Use "script_enums" from KRTX, update them as needed.**

  **Might help with crash reduction, but most script_enum errors just help not killing my computer with log size.

## \localisation
- Add in missing ones as needed, and notify the main KNR mod about them.

##
## Part 3: Still bugs but not sure how to clean these bugs out effectively
##

- Clean up all the the `basic_cruiser_armor_scheme`, `basic_heavy_armor_scheme`, `improved_heavy_armor_scheme` errors late (need to touch history files so this can be messy)
